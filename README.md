This dataset reports whether an offender is re-admitted to prison or not within three years from being released from prison in Iowa. 
The recidivism reporting year is the fiscal year (year ending June 30) marking the end of the three year tracking period.

The Department of Corrections uses recidivism as an indicator on whether strategies are reducing offenders relapse into criminal behavior. 
A three year time frame is used as studies have shown if an offender relapses into criminal behavior it is most likely to happen within three years of being released.
